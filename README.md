# notepad

Short bash script to pull up $EDITOR

---

## About

This is a short shell script I wrote up a long time ago so I could quickly pull up a scratchpad to jot notes down on my favorite editor (which currently happens to be `vi`).

It supports basic time-based tagging, as well as recovery of the most recent edit/overwrite.

It's really made for Linux, but should work on any relatively UNIXy system. Just pop `notepad.sh` in any directory on your path.
